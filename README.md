This repository contains a few Jupyter notebooks which are intended to serve as aids during some introductory lectures on Python programming.
The contents as currently planned will be as follows:

- Lesson 1: Introduction to Python. Why Python?; basic syntax; control flow; containers; basic I/O, etc.
- Lesson 2: Intermediate Python: Functions; numerical Python; plotting things; some useful modules, etc.
- Lesson 3: Advanced topics: Object Oriented Programming in Python: classes, inheritance, etc.
- Lesson 4: Introduction to Machine Learning with scikit-learn.

The intention is not to serve as a detailed reference to Python programming nor Machine Learning, but simply to motivate people starting on 
these topics, introduce them to basic concepts and generally get them going so they can fly on their own from here.
