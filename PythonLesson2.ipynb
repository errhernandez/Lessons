        "# Basic input and output\n",
        "There are many different ways in which we can handle input and output in Python; we will only cover the very basics here; those of you wanting to know more can find it all in the Python official documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say that you have written a Python script and want it to be able to interact with the user. For example, you want to ask the user's name. You will probably do something like this:\n",
        "```\n",
        "import sys\n",
        "\n",
        "sys.stdout.write('Enter your name, please:')\n",
        "name = sys.stdin.readline()\n",
        "sys.stdout.write(f'Hello {name}')\n",
        "```\n",
        "Module _sys_ is part of the Python Standard Library, and it contains a number of methods and definitions concerning the Python environment, such as the definition of the standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), command line options and things like that.\n",
        "\n",
        "More often one wants to read data from an input file. There are many different possible cases to consider. The simplest would be reading the input file (let's say it is called input.dat); you would then probably do something like this:\n",
        "```\n",
        "instream = open('input.dat', 'r')\n",
        "lines = instream.readlines()\n",
        "instream.close()\n",
        "\n",
        "for line in lines:\n",
        "    # process each line and extract data from it as needed\n",
        "    ...\n",
        "```\n",
        "In the first line we open an input stream with the __open__ command; it takes as variables the input file name and the mode, which in this case is 'r' for 'reading'. We read all the lines contained in input.dat into the list _lines_; i.e. _lines_ is an array of length equal to the number of lines in input.dat. After that we close the input stream with the __close__ method, and then we process each line in a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "We would do something very similar to write out to a file:\n",
        "```\n",
        "outstream = open('output.dat', 'w')\n",
        "\n",
        "for line in lines_to_be_written:\n",
        "    outstream.write(line)\n",
        "\n",
        "outstream.close()\n",
        "```\n",
        "These would be two basic examples of managing input and output by hand, but often you don't need to do that. Let's say you find yourself in the case in which you deal with _csv_ files, that is, files in which each line contains a list of _comma separated values_. There is a Python module called __csv__ which will make your job easier in this case. Another useful module, especially if you deal with excel files and have to do statistical analysis of your data, is the __pandas__ module. Pandas can read and write csv files as well as excel spreadshits (which in pandas are called _dataframes_). It can also plot your data via matplotlib for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other modules you may want to check out in connection with input/output are __yaml__ (for reading/writing yaml files), or __re__, for regular expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Concluding remarks to Lesson 2\n",
        "You will have noticed that int this section on input/output we have given you less to type and try out yourself. This is so because it is easiest to try these things in your own python scripts rather than in a notebook. Maybe I am old fashioned and don't know any better, but I tend to do any serious coding in a script rather than in a notebook; yes, I guess I am just plain old fashioned!\n",
