The variable phrase above is an object of the class string, and split() is a function of the class, i.e. a function that applies to string objects, splitting them as we have seen in the previous cells.

    "Things to notice here: first note how we combined the arrays _numbers_ and _more_numbers_ into a new one, _many_numbers_; another thing to notice is how we write _conditions_; in Python a condition is an expression that evaluates to True or False, and in this case, because we are checking conditions on numerical values we can use equality and inequality symbols (=, <, >, >=, etc).\n",

    "Finally, another thing to notice is how we have written the print statements this time: we have used what are called _f-strings_, so called because they begin with an _f_ followed by a usual string, but inside that string variables that are enclosed by curly braces ({}) are substituted by their value when the print statement is executed. Nice, isn't it?"
